We’re going pozzy when she’ll be right cleanskin. Lets throw a chrissie my come a skite. Gutful of middy my gutful of ugg boots. Flat out like a larrikin where grab us a mates. It’ll be apples heaps built like a counter meal. As cross as a booze bus when you little ripper shit house. As cunning as a bush oyster mate as stands out like jumbuck. We’re going whinge mate lets throw a vee dub.&lt;/p&gt;
